# Assignment_08- NoSQL

### 1. What is the main difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?  

**Answer :**

SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on a structured data model, where data is organized into tables with predefined schemas. They follow a rigid structure, with fixed columns and data types. SQL databases are best suited for complex transactions and applications that require strong data consistency, such as financial systems. They support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data integrity.

NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data. They offer a flexible data model, allowing data to be stored in various formats like key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores. NoSQL databases are highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads. They prioritize scalability and performance over strict data consistency, making them suitable for applications like social media, real-time analytics, and content management systems.

Therefore, SQL databases provide strong consistency and are ideal for structured data and complex transactions, while NoSQL databases offer flexibility, scalability, and high performance, making them a good choice for handling large amounts of unstructured data and high-traffic applications

### 2.What are some of the benefits of using NoSQL databases over traditional SQL databases?

**Answer :**

NoSQL databases offer several benefits over traditional SQL databases, making them suitable for specific use cases. Here are some of the advantages of using NoSQL databases:

1. Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, meaning they can handle large amounts of data and traffic by adding more servers to the database cluster. This makes them highly scalable and well-suited for handling big data and high-traffic applications.

2. Flexibility in Data Models: NoSQL databases provide flexibility in data modeling. Unlike SQL databases, which enforce a rigid schema, NoSQL databases allow you to store unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data formats. This flexibility makes it easier to handle diverse and evolving data types.

3. High Performance: NoSQL databases are optimized for high performance. They typically use techniques like in-memory caching and data denormalization to achieve faster read and write operations. Additionally, their distributed nature enables parallel processing and faster data retrieval.

4. Fault Tolerance and High Availability: NoSQL databases are designed to be fault-tolerant and provide high availability. They often have built-in replication and data redundancy mechanisms that ensure data is replicated across multiple nodes, minimizing the risk of data loss and providing fault tolerance.

5. Schema Evolution: NoSQL databases allow for easy schema evolution. As the data requirements change over time, you can modify the data structure without disrupting the existing data. This flexibility simplifies the development and maintenance process, especially in agile development environments.

6. Cost-Effectiveness: NoSQL databases can be more cost-effective in certain scenarios. They can run on commodity hardware and can be deployed on cloud platforms that offer pay-as-you-go pricing models, allowing you to scale resources according to demand and optimize costs.

### 4. What are the four main types of NoSQL databases, and what are their key characteristics?

**Answer**

The four main types of NoSQL databases are:

1. Key-value stores:  
Key-value stores are the simplest form of NoSQL databases. They store data in a schema-less manner, where each item in the database is associated with a unique key. The value can be any type of data, such as a string, number, JSON object, or binary data. Key-value stores provide fast and efficient retrieval of data based on the key, making them suitable for use cases that require high-performance caching, session management, and simple data models.  


Key characteristics:  
- Simple data model with key-value pairs.
- High scalability and performance.
- Fast key-based access.
- Lack of advanced querying capabilities and complex relationships between data.  

Examples: Redis, Riak, Amazon DynamoDB.

2. Document stores:  
Document stores store data in the form of documents, typically using JSON or XML formats. Each document contains data in a self-describing structure, allowing flexibility and dynamic schemas. Document databases provide rich querying capabilities, including the ability to query based on the content within the documents, making them suitable for applications with varying data structures or semi-structured data.

Key characteristics:  
- Flexible and dynamic schema.
- Document-centric querying and indexing.
- Support for complex data structures, nested objects, and arrays.
- Horizontal scalability.  

Examples: MongoDB, Couchbase, Apache CouchDB.

3. Columnar databases:  
Columnar databases organize data into columns rather than rows, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of large amounts of structured data. Data within each column is stored together, allowing for high compression ratios and improved query performance when accessing specific columns. Columnar databases are well-suited for analytical workloads that require aggregations, reporting, and ad-hoc querying of large datasets.

Key characteristics:
- Column-oriented storage.
- Compression and high data compression ratios.
- Efficient querying for aggregations and analytics.
- Schema flexibility within columns.
- Distributed and scalable architecture.

Examples: Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, Vertica.

4. Graph databases:  
Graph databases are designed to represent and store data in a graph-like structure, consisting of nodes, edges, and properties. They excel at managing highly interconnected data and relationships between entities. Graph databases offer efficient traversal of relationships and complex queries, making them ideal for use cases involving social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection, and knowledge graphs.

Key characteristics:

- Graph data model with nodes, edges, and properties.
- Traversal and pattern matching capabilities.
- Efficient handling of complex relationships.
- High performance for querying connected data.  

Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, JanusGraph.

### 5. What is the CAP theorem, and how does it relate to distributed systems ?

**Answer**  

The CAP theorem, also known as Brewer's theorem, is a fundamental principle in the field of distributed systems. It states that it is impossible for a distributed data system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:   

consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

In essence, the CAP theorem asserts that in the presence of a network partition (a scenario where nodes cannot communicate with each other due to network failures), a distributed system must choose between consistency and availability.

This means that in a distributed system, when a network partition occurs, system designers have to make a trade-off between consistency and availability. They can choose to sacrifice either consistency or availability to maintain partition tolerance.

For example, in the face of a network partition, a system can choose to prioritize consistency over availability by refusing to respond to read or write requests until the partition is resolved. Alternatively, it can prioritize availability by allowing read and write operations to proceed, even if that means temporarily providing stale or conflicting data.

It's important to note that the CAP theorem applies specifically to distributed systems, where data is stored and processed across multiple nodes. In practice, different distributed systems make different trade-offs based on their specific requirements and use cases.

### 6.What are the three properties of the CAP theorem ?  

**Answer**

The CAP theorem, also known as Brewer's theorem, states that it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following properties:

1. Consistency: Every read operation in the system will always return the most recent write or an error. In other words, all nodes in the system will see the same data at the same time.

2. Availability: Every request made to the system receives a response, regardless of whether it succeeds or fails. The system remains operational and accessible even in the presence of failures or network partitions.

3. Partition tolerance: The system continues to operate and function properly despite network partitions or communication failures between nodes. Partition tolerance ensures that the system can handle and recover from network failures without compromising its functionality.

### 7.What are the BASE properties, and how do they relate to the CAP theorem?

**Answer**

The BASE properties and the CAP theorem are concepts related to distributed database systems.

1. BASE is an acronym that stands for Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency. It represents a set of properties that are desirable in distributed systems, particularly NoSQL databases. Here's what each property means:

2. Basically Available: This means that the system guarantees availability, even in the face of network partitions or node failures. In other words, the system continues to operate and provide responses, although those responses may not always be up-to-date or complete.

3. Soft state: This property implies that the state of the system can change over time without any central coordination. Each node in the distributed system can have its own view of the data, and updates can be made independently at each node. This allows for greater scalability and performance but may result in temporary inconsistencies between different replicas of the data.

4. Eventual consistency: Eventual consistency means that given enough time and absence of further updates, all replicas of the data in the distributed system will eventually become consistent. However, during the period of inconsistency, different replicas may have different views of the data.

The CAP theorem essentially states that in the presence of a network partition (i.e., when communication between nodes is disrupted), a distributed system has to choose between consistency and availability. It cannot guarantee both. BASE properties relate to the CAP theorem because they provide an alternative approach to building distributed systems that prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency. By relaxing the consistency requirement, the BASE properties enable systems to achieve high availability and fault tolerance, making them suitable for certain types of applications where immediate consistency is not critical, such as large-scale web applications and real-time analytics systems.
